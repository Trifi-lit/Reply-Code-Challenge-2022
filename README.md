My attempt for the 2022 reply code challenge. I managed to score 20.136.296 points and rank place 147 out of more than 2.000 teams. I used a greedy approach which finds the demon with the biggest reward while penalizing high stamina cost through division. Since I was participating in the challenge alone I didn't have the time to optimize the algorithm further. The code1 gave results for inputs 1,2,4. The great amount of data in 3 and 5 made me create random samples of demons each round(1000 per round for input3 and 200 per round for input5) and then implement the greedy algorithm on that reduced sample.
